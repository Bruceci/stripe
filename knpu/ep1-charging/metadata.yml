title: Stripe: Killer Payment Processing + ??? = Profit

summary: |
    You've already got the unstoppably amazing product, you
    *just* need to get out there and sell it! Knowing that almost
    every payment-processor ever is a *huge* pain you choose
    Stripe (you're so wise).

    In this tutorial, we'll build a full checkout system for our
    awesome product and learn all about:

    - Handling the Stripe.js checkout & token process
    - Associating cards and creating Charge objects
    - Creating Stripe customers and connecting them with users
    - Building an embedded *and* a completely customer checkout form
    - Formatting your card & expiration fields like a pro
    - Being *super* graceful when things go wrong
    - Organizing everything with Stripe invoices

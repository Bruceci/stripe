title: Stripe Level 2: Subscriptions, Discounts, Web-hooks, oh my!

summary: |
    After [Part 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/stripe) of the tutorial,
    you are *rocking* with Stripe: Charges, Customer, Invoices and error-handling
    are old news.

    Now it's time to take our sheep-shearing startup to the next level: by offering
    a monthly subscription service. Woh.

    - Learn to create and charge subscriptions!
    - Store the card type and last 4 to show your user
    - Update a customer's credit card
    - Handle cancellations
    - Use web-hooks to handle renewal payments, cancellation, payment failures
    - Upgrading/Downgrading a subscription
    - Offering Coupons, Discounts and Trials
    - Giving your user's high-quality invoices

    Oh, the possibilities are endless: create a subscription service that treats
    your customers right.
